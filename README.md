You need install npm files in server directory and create the new key from https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys 
After that copy this key to server/.env
It should be "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-......"

To run: 
Enter to terminal "npm run dev"
Open new terminal go to the server "cd server" and run it by "node index.js";
